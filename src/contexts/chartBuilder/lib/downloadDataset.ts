/** Hand the bound dataset back to the user as a CSV — the round trip of the
 *  upload. A dataset that lives only inside a visual would otherwise be
 *  stranded: nothing else ever let the user get the rows back out to edit
 *  them and re-upload.
 *
 *  What goes out is the RAW rows of the version currently shown (see
 *  `currentRawDatasetViewAtom`; the preview version when one is pinned):
 *  cells exactly as imported — "$1,234.56" stays "$1,234.56" — with no
 *  cell conversion. A version that was hand-edited, reshaped or computed by
 *  a derived variable is stored rows like any other, so it exports those
 *  stored rows. An older visual's LIVE reshape and derived columns are left
 *  out: they are per-visual and wouldn't survive a re-upload. Headers are
 *  the fields' CURRENT names; renamed variables are aliased to their old
 *  headers at upload time (`Field.sourceNames`), so the file re-imports as
 *  a new version.
 *
 *  An imported version (an upload, not computed from another version) is
 *  offered under its own file name when it has a real one; anything else is
 *  named after the dataset (see `datasetCsvFilename`).
 *
 *  Like the image and bundle exports, the save goes through the browser's
 *  Save-as dialog where it has one (./saveFile.ts), so the user can rename
 *  the file and pick the folder; elsewhere it is a plain download. */
