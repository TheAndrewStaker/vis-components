/** Versions made by a reshape or a derived variable.
 *
 *  Every change to the data — a hand edit, a wide→long reshape, a derived
 *  variable added, recomputed or removed — is saved as a new data version
 *  with its rows stored, never applied live. A version made by computation
 *  records WHAT computed it in `DatasetVersion.transform`; a hand-edited
 *  version records nothing beyond `editedFrom`. The pieces here read those
 *  records:
 *
 *  - {@link describeVersionOrigin}: the version list's "· reshaped" /
 *    "· added “Trend”" / "· edited by hand" tag.
 *  - {@link derivedVariablesOfVersion}: which of a version's columns a
 *    derived variable made, and with what definition — so the tray's ƒ
 *    marker can reopen it, and the editor can recompute it.
 *  - {@link renameFieldInTransform}: a field rename reaches the stored
 *    definitions too, so a renamed column keeps its ƒ. */
