/** Replaying a working copy's functional changes onto a fresh import.
 *
 *  A reshape and a derived variable are functions of the data; a hand edit
 *  is a patch on particular cells. So when a fresher file of the same shape
 *  is uploaded as a new version of a working copy (2024 data → 2025 data),
 *  the upload is checked against the columns of the IMPORT the copy's
 *  changes descend from — not the latest version's — and, once appended,
 *  every version a reshape or a derived variable made is re-done over it,
 *  in chain order, one new version per step; the hand-edited versions are
 *  skipped. A step whose inputs the fresh data lacks (a variable reading a
 *  column a hand edit had added, a reshape over columns the file doesn't
 *  have) is left out and reported, and the rest still replay.
 *
 *  Pure. The pieces:
 *  - {@link importRootId}: the import a version's chain descends from.
 *  - {@link functionalSteps}: the versions of that chain that record a
 *    `transform`, oldest first — what a replay re-does.
 *  - {@link runReplayStep}: one step over a table — the SAME code path the
 *    preview (over no rows) and the real append (over the fresh rows) run,
 *    so what the dialog promises is what lands.
 *  - {@link previewImport}: the upload's compatibility verdict and the
 *    replay plan the Add-data dialog shows.
 *  The store side — appending the versions — is
 *  `store/appendImportVersion.ts`. */
