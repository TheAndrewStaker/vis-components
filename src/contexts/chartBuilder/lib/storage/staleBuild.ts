// A build that is BEHIND the server's content schema must not write.
//
// Chart saves carry no version of their own, so a tab still running the
// previous bundle after a deploy would write the previous SHAPE back over
// migrated content — and nothing would migrate it again, because the
// server's stamp already says the collection is current. So every write
// to a versioned collection names the content version this build writes
// (`x-vis-content-version`), and the server answers 409 when that is
// behind its stamp. This module is the client half: the header, and the
// one-way "this build is stale" flag the banner reads so the user knows to
// reload (the editor draft is kept in localStorage, so nothing is lost).
