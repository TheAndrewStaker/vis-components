/** A SAVED reference to one facet panel — what a facet scope (`facetKeys`
 *  on annotations and data labels) lists.
 *
 *  Wrap mode's panel is one facet value, and the value itself is the
 *  reference. A grid panel is a row value AND a column value, carried as a
 *  pair so neither is ever joined to the other: a saved key built by
 *  joining user values (`row|col`) is ambiguous when a value contains the
 *  joiner, and reads as something it isn't to anything that inspects
 *  stored content (the hosting firewall flagged `__all__|Type of System`
 *  as a shell pipe). The unmapped side of a row-only / col-only grid holds
 *  the `FACET_PANEL_ALL` placeholder, the same one the in-memory panel key
 *  carries there.
 *
 *  The RENDERER keys panels by a string (`FacetPanels.values`: the facet
 *  value, or `row|col`); that key never leaves memory. `facetPanelKeyOf`
 *  maps a reference onto it, which is how scope checks match.
 *
 *  A plain string that looks like a grid key (`"a|x"`) is also what every
 *  grid scope saved before pairs existed holds. The string form still
 *  matches by key, so such a visual keeps rendering as it did; the load
 *  and save paths rewrite it to a pair (`lib/savedKeyStructure.ts`). */
