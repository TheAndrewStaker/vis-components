/** Hand edits to a data set (the data tray's Edit dialog).
 *
 *  Changing the data never mutates imported data: the first change to an
 *  imported data set — a hand edit, a reshape, a derived variable — FORKS
 *  it (a new data set whose v1 is a copy of the version shown and whose v2
 *  is the change), and later changes to that WORKING COPY append versions to
 *  it (`store/commitDatasetVersion.ts`). Every such version names the
 *  version it was made from (`DatasetVersion.editedFrom`); a hand-edited
 *  one records nothing else, a computed one records its `transform`. The
 *  data table outlines every cell a hand edit changed against the nearest
 *  version that wasn't one — the BASE: follow `editedFrom` through
 *  hand-edited versions and stop at an import, a reshape or a derived
 *  variable. The pieces here are pure:
 *
 *  - {@link planEditedFields}: which columns of the edited text are the
 *    old columns (same or former name), which are renamed, added, dropped.
 *  - {@link alignEditedRows}: which cells of the edited rows differ from
 *    the base rows, tolerant of rows added, removed and re-ordered.
 *  - {@link editBaseVersionId}: the base of a version's hand-edit chain.
 *  - {@link isWorkingCopy}: whether a change forks or appends. */
